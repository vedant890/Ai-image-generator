AI Image Generator Web App using Text Prompt
In recent years, the field of artificial intelligence has grown rapidly and has seen tremendous success in various applications. One of these applications is in image generation, where deep learning models are used to generate images based on textual input. This has led to the development of several AI-based image generators that are used in fields such as graphic design, digital marketing, and art.

The AI image generator web app using text prompt is a platform that allows users to generate images based on text prompts provided by them. The app uses advanced deep learning models to create images that are similar to the text prompt given by the user. Additionally, the app features a community showcase where users can share their generated images and get feedback from others. This feature fosters creativity and encourages collaboration among users. The app also has a built-in tool for generating prompts based on a topic or subject provided by the user, making the image generation process more accessible and efficient.

Objective
The objective of this project report is to present the development and implementation of the AI image generator web app using text prompt. This report will detail the design and development of the app's user interface, the deep learning models used for image generation, and the community showcase feature. Additionally, the report will discuss the app's prompt generator tool and its importance in making the image generation process more accessible to users. Finally, the report will present the results of the app's testing and evaluation, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating images and fostering creativity among its users.

Software Requirements
